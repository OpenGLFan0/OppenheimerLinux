Disclaimer: The first 3 folders are build folders and not neccessary unless you want to recongifure and rebuild the system to change and tweak it.
Rootfs.img the boot hdd to start the system is too big to be uploaded here so please download it off google drive here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFoUSqfYzzLDTtJYbY_gGY9a1xaACUZw/view?usp=sharing

How to run: Install qemu and qemu-system (x86_64) on your systems package manager. Open OppenhiemerlinuxQemuCommand.txt and change ~/usr in the 3 system file directories to your systems username or root then copy and paste it into terminal to run the system. Have fun and please give me feedback on the base system!

Version 0.01 New turn, Linux Kernel 6.16.0 all hardware support has been configured with lowest compression and minimal base system userspace using busybox we hope you can build on yourselfs or join my team to build this distro into a big and stable one!
